Few words about git

## Tutorial

For the tutorial you're going use the image we're giving.


To build and run the game, use docker: `docker build -t githug . && docker run -it githug`

Then you can start the game with the command `githug` and answering `yes` to the question.
There is 55 Question. The 56 is really optional :)

### How to play

  - `play` is used to test current solution.
  - `hint` to get an hint.
  - `rest` ... to reset the current level.

Sometime the game will ask you a command, once you made the command just use the command `play`
eg `create a README`:

``` shell
$ touch README
$ play
```

Sometime it will be a question, find the answer and use the command `play`.
eg `how much does 3 + 6`

``` shell
$ play
How much ? 9
$
```
